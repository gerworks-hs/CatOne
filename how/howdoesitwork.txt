How does CatOne work?

*CatOne supports relative paths and absolute paths
*CatOne on its first version can archive up to 255 files
*CatOne on its first version cannot archive files bigger than 10^9 bytes (1GB)

The CatOne archive layout:
	A CatOne archive is setup like this:
		The first 14 are the archive header: "CATONE ARCHIVE" encoded in ASCII, its HEX is: 0x4341544f4e452041524348495645
		The next byte is the number of files in the archive, it MUST be at least 1 and up to 255, even if 0 is possible in binary
		Then each file saved in the archive will have a CATONE prefix before its real data like this:
		"-<index from 1 to 255(1byte)>-<file name (1byte)>-<file size in bytes(10^9bytes max)>"
		The CATONE prefix will be placed right after the end of the previous file entry in the archive or the header if its the first file

CatOne takes a minimum of 3 arguments that are explained below:

	1-> The input method, the mode you want CatOne to read your input files, it can be: "roll" or "index"
	2-> The final archive name, the name that the resulting archive will have, it would be great to choose .co as file extension (CatOne)
	3-> The rest:
		If ur input method is "roll" the rest of the arguments after the final archive name will be the name of your input files
		If ur input method is "index" the third and last argument will be the file used as index that must follow an specific format

Index file format:
	The file must have in its first line the following (without ""): "---CATONE INDEX FILE---"
	The second line will be: "FILE COUNT:<file count>"
	Then the file needs to have at least <file count> + 1 more lines
	Each line after the second one needs to have the following format: "<index>:<file name>"
	The last line must be: "END OF INDEX FILE"
	An example of index file could be this file called myindex.co.index
		---CATONE INDEX FILE---
		---FILE COUNT: 3 :---
		1:file1.txt
		2:/home/user/samplefile
		3:/root/.bashrc
		---END OF INDEX FILE---

Examples:
	catone index myarchive.co myindex.co.index
	catone roll mysecondarchive.co file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt

The index input method is cleaner and simpler but roll could be easier to use with less files
